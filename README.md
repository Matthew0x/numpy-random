## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This README describes work done on the numpy.random package for the Programming for Data Analysis module assessment, due 11 November 2019. Resources used include Python and associated packages Jupyter, matplotlib, and NumPy. The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository and run Jupyter notebook, which comes as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python (as do the other packages listed above). Alternatively, view a static version of the notebook (by providing its GitHub url) using Jupyter Nbviewer. 

## The purpose of the numpy.random package  <a name="section1"></a>
What is a distribution function? Why are they needed? Why so many different types?

To quote WIKIPEDIA: In probability theory and statistics, a **probability distribution** is a mathematical function that provides the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. It describes the likliehood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can take on. For example, the summer temperature values in Galway will fall within a fairly consistent range with some average value being the most likely one. The variable (temperature) can theoretically take on any value, but certain values are more likely to occur than others and there will be some spread in the measured values. This experiment could be simulated with a probability distribution. There are other experiemnts where the output is discrete rather than continuous. The simplest example of such an experiment is to imagine flipping a coin a number of times and attempting to predict how often each of the possible outcomes, heads (H) or tails (T), will occur. Here, the possible outcomes are discrete (H or T) and each is as likely to occar as the other with a fair coin. The numpy.random package provides the ability to simulate any random process as it can be used to generate sample values from many types of probability distribution.

## The use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers <a name="section4"></a>
Pseudorandom numbers (as opposed to *random* numbers) are generated in the computer by algorithms, the bahviour of which can be predicted depending on the seed of the random number generator.
